""" --- PART 1: DICTIONARY BASICS & CREATION ---
1. Create a dictionary representing a 'Laptop' with keys: brand, model, and price.
2. Access the value of the 'model' key using square brackets.
3. Access the value of a key that doesn't exist using .get() and explain why it's safer than [].
4. Create an empty dictionary using both {} and the dict() constructor.
5. Add a new key-value pair 'processor': 'i7' to an existing dictionary.
6. Update the 'price' of the laptop to a new value.
7. Use the len() function to find how many key-value pairs are in a dictionary.
8. Create a dictionary where the keys are numbers 1 to 5 and the values are their squares.
9. Check if a specific key exists in a dictionary using the 'in' operator.
10. Delete a key-value pair using the 'del' keyword and handle the case if the key is missing.
--- PART 2: METHODS & MANIPULATION ---
11. Use the pop() method to remove a key and store its value in a variable.
12. Use popitem() to remove the last inserted item and explain its behavior in Python 3.7+.
13. Use the keys() method to print all the keys in a dictionary.
14. Use the values() method to print all the values in a dictionary.
15. Use the items() method to iterate through a dictionary and print "Key: Value" for each
pair.
16. Merge two dictionaries: {'a': 1, 'b': 2} and {'c': 3, 'd': 4} using the update() method.
17. Clear all items from a dictionary using the clear() method.
18. Use the setdefault() method to add a key 'country' with value 'India' only if it doesn't exist.
19. Create a shallow copy of a dictionary and show that modifying the copy doesn't change
the original.
20. Create a dictionary from two lists: one for keys and one for values using the zip()
function.
--- PART 3: NESTED DICTIONARIES (API STYLE) ---
21. Create a nested dictionary called 'Employees' containing data for three different people.
22. Access a value inside a nested dictionary (e.g., Employees['emp1']['salary']).
23. Update a value inside a nested dictionary.
24. Add a new nested dictionary (a new employee) to the existing 'Employees' structure.
25. Write a loop to print only the names of all employees from the nested 'Employees'
dictionary.
26. Create a dictionary where a key points to a list of values (e.g., 'hobbies': ['coding',
'reading']).
27. Append a new hobby to the list inside that dictionary.
28. Given a dictionary of students and their marks (a list), calculate the average marks for one
student.
29. Flatten a simple nested dictionary (convert {'a': {'b': 1}} to {('a', 'b'): 1}).
30. Represent a JSON response from a weather API as a nested dictionary and extract the
'temperature'.
--- PART 4: COMPREHENSIONS & LOGIC ---
31. [Comprehension] Create a dictionary of even numbers between 1-10 as keys and their
cubes as values.
32. [Comprehension] Given a dictionary, create a new one with only items where the value is
> 100.
33. [Comprehension] Swap keys and values in a dictionary (Reverse Mapping).
34. Sort a dictionary by its keys in alphabetical order.
35. Sort a dictionary by its values in ascending order.
36. Find the key with the maximum value in a dictionary of product prices.
37. Count the frequency of each character in a string "Python Trainer" using a dictionary.
38. Combine two dictionaries by adding values for common keys.
39. Convert a dictionary into a list of tuples.
40. Check if all values in a dictionary are the same.
--- PART 5: INDUSTRIAL & INTERVIEW SCENARIOS ---
41. [JSON] Use the 'json' module to convert a dictionary into a JSON string.
42. [Data Cleaning] Remove all keys from a dictionary that have None or empty string
values.
43. [Security] Explain why a list cannot be used as a dictionary key, but a tuple can.
44. [Logic] Write a program to find the sum of all values in a numeric dictionary.
45. [Simulation] Use a dictionary to simulate a simple "Switch-Case" statement logic.
46. [Efficiency] Compare the time it takes to find a value in a list of 10,000 items vs. a
dictionary.
47. [Functionality] Use **kwargs in a function to accept arbitrary keyword arguments as a
dictionary.
48. [Mapping] Create a dictionary to map Roman numerals to Integers (e.g., 'I': 1, 'V': 5).
49. [Logic] Given a list of words, group them by their starting letter using a dictionary.
50. [Interview Question] Explain the difference between '==' and 'is' when comparing two
identical dictionaries."""
