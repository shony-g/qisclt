""" -- PART 1: BASICS & INITIALIZATION ---
8. Unpack a tuple of 3 elements into three variables: x, y, and z.
9. Demonstrate what happens if you try to unpack a tuple of 4 elements into 3 variables.
10. Use the 'extended iterable unpacking' (using *) to grab the first element and the rest into a
list.
--- PART 2: IMMUTABILITY LOGIC ---
11. Write code that attempts to change the first element of a tuple and handle the resulting
TypeError gracefully.
12. Given a tuple: t = (1, 2, [3, 4]). Change the value 3 to 30. Explain why this works despite
tuples being immutable.
13. Create two tuples, concatenate them, and assign them to a new variable.
14. Use the repetition operator (*) to create a tuple of ten zeros.
15. Swap two variables a and b using tuple unpacking logic in a single line.
16. Write a program to "add" an item to a tuple by converting it to a list first.
17. Write a program to "remove" an item from a tuple.
18. Delete an entire tuple variable from memory and verify its absence using a try-except
block.
19. Sort a tuple of integers and return the result as a new tuple.
20. Reverse a tuple using the slicing method [::-1].
--- PART 3: METHODS & AGGREGATION ---
21. Find the index of the first occurrence of the number 10 in a tuple.
22. Count how many times the string "Python" appears in a tuple of job roles.
23. Find the maximum and minimum values in a tuple of stock prices.
24. Calculate the sum of all numeric elements in a tuple.
25. Given a tuple of tuples: ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)), calculate the sum of the second element of
each internal tuple.
26. Use the index() method to find the position of 'Apple' starting from index 3 in a large fruit
tuple.
27. Write a function that takes a tuple and returns a new tuple containing only the even
numbers.
28. Convert a list of tuples into a single flat list.
29. Create a tuple from a user-input string where each character is an element.
30. Check if all elements in a tuple are truthy using the all() function.
--- PART 4: SLICING & LOOPING ---
31. Extract a sub-tuple containing the elements from index 2 to 5 (inclusive).
32. Use slicing to get every second element of a tuple.
33. Write a 'for' loop to print each element of a tuple with its corresponding index number.
34. Use a 'while' loop to iterate through a tuple backwards.
35. Create a tuple of 10 numbers and slice it to get the last 3 elements.
36. Slice a tuple to remove the first and last elements.
37. Use a for loop to concatenate all strings in a tuple into a single sentence.
38. Compare two tuples (1, 2, 3) and (1, 2, 4). Explain the logic of how Python compares
them.
39. Write a program to find duplicate elements in a tuple.
40. Zip two tuples together to create a list of coordinate pairs."""
